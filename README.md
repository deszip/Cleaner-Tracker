# Cleaner

### About
Cleaner is designed by developers, for developers. This tool simplifies the process of decluttering unnecessary files, focusing on those that are either expendable or easily restorable.

Please note: The developers of Cleaner have never accessed Xcode's source code. As a result, recommendations for each module might become outdated with newer versions of Xcode.
